## Overview

**shadcnspace is not a traditional component library or a replacement for shadcn/ui.**   
Instead, it’s a curated collection of **production-ready components, blocks, and layouts** with flexible variants.

You can **preview, customize, and copy-paste** everything directly into your project — no lock-in, no abstractions, no black boxes.

Built on top of the solid foundation of **shadcn/ui**, shadcnspace extends it with thoughtfully designed components and real-world UI blocks. The goal is simple: **help you build faster without sacrificing control or code quality**.


### Not a library — a component distribution

Following the core philosophy of shadcn, **shadcnspace is not an “install-from-npm” UI library**.

Instead, it’s an **open-source distribution of components**:

- 📋 Copy the source code directly
- 🎨 Modify styles and variants freely
- 🧠 Adjust logic to fit your app
- 🔧 Integrate seamlessly with your existing stack

There are **no hidden abstractions or runtime dependencies**.  
The code is yours to own, adapt, and evolve.

This **open-code approach** gives you full confidence and flexibility — so your UI scales with your product, not against it.


## Why should I use shadcnspace? 🤔

shadcnspace builds on the core philosophy of shadcn/ui while focusing on what teams often need next: **more ready-to-use variants, richer examples, and complete UI blocks**. It provides a growing collection of components, blocks, and layouts designed around real product use cases, helping developers move beyond primitives and assemble interfaces faster.

While preserving the copy-and-paste, open-code approach, shadcnspace aims to offer a **more guided and practical experience**. By showcasing multiple variants, sensible defaults, and pre-built patterns, it reduces the cognitive load of starting from scratch — without taking away flexibility or control over the code.


## This is where shadcnspace shines ✨

shadcnspace takes the core strengths of shadcn/ui and supercharges them with a **developer-first experience**. Here’s what makes it stand out:

- **Components** – Browse a rich collection of UI components, from buttons and forms to navigation menus and cards, ready to copy, customize, and use in your projects.  
- **Blocks** – Pre-built UI patterns and sections that combine multiple components into functional layouts, helping you assemble pages faster.  
- **Templates** – Full-page or partial templates to kickstart projects with consistent design and structure, saving you setup time.  
- **MCP Server** – Connect shadcnspace to an MCP server to automate workflows, fetch component details, and integrate AI-assisted tooling directly into your development process.
